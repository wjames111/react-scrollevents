# react-scrollevents

> React component for adding scroll events

# About
The react-scrollevents package is a useful react component for any project requiring scroll interaction in its UI. Whether that be an animation triggered once scrolled to, infinite scroller, or scroll scrubbing, this component should make your job a lot easier. The component returns a handy callback allowing you to write your own scroll interactions without having to set it up yourself. After implementing something similar in several other projects I figured it was time to set up a well-documented reusable component without any extra unneeded functionality. There are several great projects already available for this kind of thing including react-scrollmagic. However, if you're looking for bare bones functionality or are not using the GSAP animation library react-scrollevents is a great option.

# Adding react-scrollevents

#### 1. cd into your project and run

```bash
npm install --save react-scrollevents
```

#### 1. import react-scrollevents component into a class component

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import ScrollEvents from 'react-scrollevents';


class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ScrollEvents />
      </div>
      )
  }
}
```

#### 1. ScrollEvents requires two parameters, a triggerElements prop and a onScrollYCallback prop.

* TriggerElements takes a react ref, if multiple elements will be triggered please pass the refs in an array. TriggerElements will also take a className or id selector as a string, although this is not advised.

* onScrollYCallback requires a function that will be called during each trigger. This callback should accept three arguments, the element triggered, the action (start or end), and the element's scroll progress.

  * onScrollYCallback can be split up into multiple functions based on action. To do this pass in an object with a start, progress and end method.
ie
> {
    start: this.onScrollStart,
    progress: this.onScrollProgress,
    end: this.onScrollEnd,
   }


```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import ScrollEvents from 'react-scrollevents';


class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.triggerOne = React.createRef();
    this.triggerTwo = React.createRef();
  }

  onScrollY(element, action, progress) {
    // trigger whatever action or animation here
    if (action == 'start' || action == 'end') {
      console.log(element + ' ' + action);
    } else {
      console.log(`${element} has been scrolled ${progress} percent`);
    }
  }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div ref={this.triggerOne}>
        </div>
        <div ref={this.triggerTwo}>
        </div>
        <ScrollEvents
          triggerElements={[this.triggerOne, this.triggerTwo]}
          onScrollYCallback={this.onScrollY}
          />
      </div>
      )
  }
}
```

# Additional Props
name | type | optional | default
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
triggerElements | array, react ref or string | no | required
onScrollYCallback | function or object | no | required
scrollContainer | string or react ref element | yes | window
isIndicator | boolean | yes | true
indicatorPlacement | string or number | yes | 50%
indicatorStyles | object | yes | {}
isReplayable | boolean | yes | true
isDebounce | boolean | yes | true
debounceAmount | number | yes | 15
customComponent | react component | yes | null


## Optional Props Explained
* scrollContainer is used to attach the event listener to. By default, it's attached to the window object.

* isIndicator adds a pointer for debugging purposes.

* indicatorPlacement defines where in the scrollContainer elements should be triggered.

* indicatorStyles allows you to redefine what the pointer looks like. Useful for creating a sticky element.

* isReplayable allows elements to be triggered more than once.

* isDebounce determines if scroll event should use debounce.

* debounceAmount will determine the length of the debounce in ms.

* customComponent allows child components to be added inside the scrollEvents component.
