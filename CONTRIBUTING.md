## Making a PR

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/wjames111/react-scrollevents/pulls) for previous Pull Request that may cover your issue:

* Make your changes in a new git branch:
  * use branch names that suggest what your changing

     ```shell
     git checkout -b bugfix-proptypes-001 master
     ```

* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message:

* test your changes locally:

* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin bugfix-proptypes-001
    ```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `react-scrollevents:master`.

* If changes are suggested:
  * Make appropriate updates.
  * test again locally.
  * If necessary, rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push origin bugfix-proptypes-001 -f
    ```

## JavaScript/JSX
* Make sure JS code is neat, readable and DRY:
* JS code is well documented and should be straightforward:
* Ideally code would follow Aribnb's JavaScript Styleguide using their eslint config:
* I've added several rules to eslintrc to introduce more whitespace. Feel free to do the same:
